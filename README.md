# Keltner Channel

Keltner Channel is a "bands"-type custom indicator for MT4 and MT5 coded by EarnForex.com. It was originally developed by Chester W. Keltner. It uses moving averages to form a channel, which can be used to detect potential trend reversals and continuations.

By default, Keltner Channel uses simple moving averages of the typical price. You can change this via the input parameters.
